# Rage with the Machine: Architectures of Control and Resistance

## I. DH

Hello and thank you for inviting me to talk here today.

My name is Dennis Tenen. I teach Digital Humanities and New Media Studies at Columbia University. I use both of these terms reluctantly, as someone who was adopted into the family not by choice, but by necessity. A colleague described my approach to the field as skeptical engagement and I took it as a compliment. I speak English with an accent, as you will note, and I speak the language of New Media with yet another layer of idiosyncratic inflection. I would like to preserve both accents. The outside perspective is a position of strength. As an immigrant and as a Jew I reserve the right not to get too comfortable. 

Enough about me. I was invited here to talk about protest. When we think about protest we think about big protest: major events: riots, strikes, and revolutions. What I want to talk about today is little protest: not as a singular event, but as a process. What is the opposite of protest? Acquiescence to some tyrannical force. The opposite to little protest is soft tyranny--the ways in which control is established in small steps often in non-obvious imperceptible to us ways. Protest as a singular event, discrete and dramatic, is not the best tool to counteract soft tyranny: just as occasional fasting does not equate to the effects of a healthy diet. Resistance against the daily gnawing of soft tyranny is more difficult to enact in some ways. It requires vigilance and strength of resolve. These words mean nothing to you yet, but by the end of this talk I would like to convince you to join a specific little protest, against forces that unremittingly conspire to transform our collective intellectual lives here at the university.

The plan for today is three-fold:

First, to talk to you about digital humanities in general: about the movement's transformative potential and the frankly, about its hype.  Second, to explore several case studies, that represent facets of the same overarching concern about the role of technology in humanistic practice. Finally, to contextualize these case studies within an idea that offers some cautious solutions for a way forward. I will try to keep my remarks to 30-40 minutes and leave plenty of time for q&a at the end of the talk. That should take us to the top of the next hour. Please feel free to interrupt with questions or comments as needed.

Let’s start with digital humanities. What are the digital humanities or DH for short? My answer to that question is in part descriptive and in part normative or aspirational. It is the way I see the field but also the way I think it should be. 

In surveying the diverse practices of my colleagues, I observe three major trends, three pillars that prop up the whole project.  The first, I will call broadly computational culture studies. I understand computational culture studies (and it is the term I prefer to describe my own research) in two ways. First as the study of computational culture:  a critical and historical reflection on technology with intellectual roots that go back to Plato, Descartes, Spencer, Marx, Heidegger, Latour and many others. Second, I understand computational culture studies as computational approaches to the study of culture (and in my case, primarily computational approaches to the study of literature and textuality). In that light, computation can be seen as a major tectonic shift with broad implications, moving industry and academia alike. Witness computational economics, computational medicine, computational sociology, computational biology, and so on. That first pillar of digital humanities is held together by computation, both as an object and as a method of study.

The second pillar supporting DH I will call broadly knowledge design or knowledge architecture. The shallow origins of DH stem back to the problems posed narrowly by archive digitization. For this reason, the “first wave” DH scholars of the 80s and 90s were intimately involved in the development of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), an xml standard that has enabled a thriving ecosystem of online archives. The Perseus project, which hosts a concordance of classical Greek texts is one of the flagships of TEI application. I cannot imagine teaching the classics without it. 

Zotero (who uses Zotero here for citation management) is another success story. What started as a small citation manager plugin for Firefox, developed at the Center for History and Media at George Mason University, is now a powerful best in breed tool to organize and share research. My students tell me it fundamentally changes the way they study and write papers. Best of all, Zotero is free and open source, allowing the community to extend the core code base.

But there is much more to knowledge design and architecture than web standards or citation managers. If you think about it, the humanities have always been involved in shaping and organizing the material structure of language, thought, and ideas. The library is an obvious piece of knowledge architecture. A paragraph or a book chapter is too. Book design, data visualization, the museum and the publishing house, the classroom--whether we decide to lecture to lead a discussion, to stand in front of the class or sit in a circle--these are all structures for the mind. The humanities, which in the age of high theory have all but abandoned materiality, are now working with artists, designers, librarians, and publishers to re-imagine the future of libraries, museums, archives, journals and journalism, the future of the book, the future of publishing. 

Finally, digital humanities signify a return to the material conditions of knowledge production. This includes unfair labor practices in the educational sector; a reexamination of our publishing ecosystem, which so often relies on unnecessary paywalls and profit-driven middlemen. Drawing inspiration from free culture and open access movements, much work in the digital humanities attempts to redress global and regional imbalances of access to information. These essentially political concerns, respond to the larger problematic put before our time: issues of privacy and transparency, censorship and net neutrality, security and surveillance, artificial intelligence and algorithmic imagination.

You can see by now, that my vision of the Digital Humanities is not all that digital, or rather, not merely digital. The spirit of the thing is to connect what we were always good at thinking, with doing. My two-word definition for DH is just that thinking and doing. And it is thinking and doing in a different way: 

| old              | new                   |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| dogmatic         | pragmatic             |
| solitary         | cooperative           |
| discipline-bound | project-based         |
| resource-starved | entrepreneurial       |
| hierarchical     | flat                  |
| top-down         | bottom up             |
| prestige         | problem solving       |
| conservative     | transformative        |

But also DH can be: 

instrumental
shallow
atheoretical
ahistorical
tool obsessed
meta solipsistic
administrative
sensationalist hype and kool-aid (not unlike big data)


II: Case Studies

Keeping the good, the bad, and the ugly in mind, allow me to quickly sketch out four case studies from the trenches of digital humanities at Columbia, but I suspect stories to you have encountered daily here at Glasgow as well. 

A. Aleph
How are they able to do so much with so little? The disparity in outcomes per dollar spent cannot be explained in terms of intellectual property alone.

B. Open Syllabus Project
I realized that open access and surveillance exist on the same side of the transparency spectrum. Both can be described as unfettered access to data in aggregate. 

C. Rap Genius 
A part of the semantic web. Started out as a rap annotation site. 15mil investment from Andersson Horowitz. 

Them pitching the core. (Check if everyone knows the core)

Litigation with National Music Publishers Association. Google search penalty. 

D. Material contexts of knowledge production.

Average cost per article is $4000. Some of the numbers that have elicited gasps (or should have) begin to line up now. Where is the money coming from? The library. Where is it going? Going to the gatekeepers--giant multi-national corporations that harvest, aggregate, and monetize data. To this list we may add Google, Twitter, Facebook. These platforms may enable localized singular events of protest. But they also set up a much more pervasive hidden infrastructure of control. What is to be done? And how can you help?

Transition. 


III:  What is to be done? 

Mumford, Lewis. "Authoritarian and Democratic Technics," Technology and Culture Vol 5.1 (Winter 1964), 1-8.

>The center of authority in this new system is no longer a visible personality, an all-powerful king: even in totalitarian dictatorships the center now lies in the system itself, invisible but omnipresent: all its human components, even the technical and managerial elite, even the sacred priesthood of science, who alone have access to the secret knowledge by means of which total control is now swiftly being effected, are themselves trapped by the very perfection of the organization they have invented. Like the Pharoahs of the Pyramid Age, these servants of the system identify its goods with their own kind of well-being: as with the divine king, their praise of the system is an act of self-worship; and again like the king, they are in the grip of an irrational compulsion to extend their means of control and expand the scope of their authority. In this new systems-centered collective, this Pentagon of power, there is no visible presence who issues commands: unlike Job's God, the new deities cannot be confronted, still less defied. Under the pretext of saving labor, the ultimate end of this technics is to displace life, or rather, to transfer the attributes of life to the machine and the mechanical collective, allowing only so much of the organism to remain as may be controlled and manipulated.

Winner, Langdon. "Do Artifacts Have Politics?" in *The Whale and the Reactor: a Search for Limits in an Age of High Technology.* Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1986.  
 
> The things we call "technologies" are ways of building order in our world. Many technical devices and systems important in everyday life contain possibilities for many different ways of ordering human activity [...] societies choose structures for technologies that influence how people are going to work, communicate, travel, consume, and so forth over a long period of time [...] By far, **the greatest latitude of choice exists the very first time a particular instrument, system, or technique is introduced**. Because choices tend to become strongly fixed in material equipment, economic investment, and social habit, the original flexibility vanishes from all practical purposes one the initial commitments are made.

> In that sense technological innovations are similar to legislative acts or political founding that establish a framework for public order that will endure for many generations. For that reason, the same careful attention once would give to the rules, roles, and relationship of politics must also be given to such things as the building of highways, the creation of television networks, and the tailoring of seemingly insignificant features on new machines. **The issues that divide or unite people in society are settled not only in the institutions and practices political proper, but also, and less obviously, in tangible arrangements of steel and concrete, wires and transistors, nuts and bolts**.

Scarry, Elaine. "Citizenship in Emergency," *Boston Review* Vol. 27, No. 5, October/November 2002.

* openness
* consent
* deliberation
* participation
* agency (ability to change the world and the material constraints of technology itself)

Some extra slides.

If you are one of the people who are thinking "yeah, that's not for me," "too much work," "sounds difficult." Please stop. Consider what you care about. If you have any hope of reaching an audience beyond these walls, more than 20-30 people gathered here, if you don't want to waste years of your life on writing and scholarship on a piece of paper that reaches literally one or two people, consider raging with the machine. Take intellectual interest in the tools of your labor--your cellphone, the lapttop that occupies most of your day. Take control of communication vectors. Own, and I mean actually own, the material contexts of your work. 

In the university that means we must chose technology not just on the basis of learning or research outcomes (ease of use, features), but as a legislative process which deeply affects the long term power dynamics between students, faculty, administration, and the world. If, as experience tells us, the arrangement of classroom chairs have a significant impact on the quality of the discussion and the sense of the audience in a conversation, so much more can be said about the architecture of shared reading, online discussion, bibliographic managment, word processing, and everything else that normally goes under the boring name of “office productivity”. Rather than treating this technological scaffolding as mere furniture, we must understand it as culture. The question is not “what kind of tools I should use for this or that purpose,” but what kind of culture do I contribute to on a daily basis."

And that question is actually easier to answer, because while technology may be opaque to us, we are consummate scholars of culture and politics. Far from arguing for technological determinism, I would like to say that the ideals of technology cannot come from technology itself. They must be made all the clearer in the formative, legislative period of technological innovation. In the Columbia Core, at the library, at the publishing press which are all instututions currently reconsidering its digital toolkit, the ideals of openness, consent, deliberation, participation, and agency are embodied in the core texts themselves, from Plato, Kant, Sartre, and Arendt. We need only to remember these ideals in establishing new modes of research, learning, activism, and resistance.
